## C Programming

It is a repository about my studies of the C language, has codes of online exercises like the pointer's folder, university exercises and the contents studied in the book **"The C Book, Featuring the ANSI C Standard"** by Michael Francis Banahan.

I believe that the help of a good book, practice and constancy are the keys to achieve more knowledge in some area. 
The book will give you some insights that you still haven't learned or just skipped at some time, the practice with constancy will fix the content in your mind and turns the knowledge more flexible. 

We know that the C language is the base of the computation, many programming languages use C as base, the Linux Kernel is implemented on C, some aspects of Windows Kernel is devoped in C, OS X also use C, mobile devices uses C, this language still remains active in our lives, so why not learn it? ? Studying this you achieve some understanding about some behaviors of high level programming languages like Java or Python, C is less abstract, you really manage the things.
